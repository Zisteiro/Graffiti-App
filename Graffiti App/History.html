    <h4>Beginnings</h4>
    <p>All started with simple "tags" in the Bronx, later it became popular and lost of teenagers started the movement. Painting trains and things like that, lately with subway trains being increasingly inaccessible, the Clean Train Movement started in 1989. Because of this, many graffiti artists had to resort to new ways to express themselves. Roof tops became the new billboards for some 80s-era writers</p>
